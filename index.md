## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

Lab 1, part 1 
I liked this lab because it was my first and it was very simple. It was also the classic "Hello World" which is stereotypical for being many aspiring coders' first program.

Lab 5, part 1 
I found this lab interesting as it was an introduction on how to implement equations to find a desired output through code. In the lab we were meant to find the area of a rectanlge by initializing a length and width value, and then multiplying those two values by eachother.

Lab 7, part 1
This is my favorite lab because I found the code pertaining to the command line size and the if statements incredibly satisfying. The code itself came out looking visually pleasing aswell.
